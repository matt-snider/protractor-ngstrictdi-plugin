# protractor-ngstrictdi-plugin
A [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/#/) plugin to look for and report dependency injection errors in [Angular](https://angularjs.org/). This plugin requires that the ngStrictDi directive is used on the same element that ngApp is declared (see [Dependency Injection](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/di))
